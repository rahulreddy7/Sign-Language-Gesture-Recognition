Python Notebooks:
There are twwo python notebooks in this folder. "Pre-processing.ipynb" has all the implementations of the tasks that Prof. Banerjee has provided. 
The Tasks include: 
1. Retreiving requests from cloud and downloading the input video. 
2. Frame Extraction
3. Posenet
4. Segmentation
5. Cropping Algorithm
6. CNN model prediction
7. Send the result to Cloud(S3)

"CNN_Model.ipynb" has the training process of CNN model. The tasks shown in this are:
1. Downloading the dataset from Kaggle
2. Exporting the data into lists. Reading the image file via opencv and performing data processing
3. BUilding and training the model across the specified batch size and epochs
4. Save the weights into H5
